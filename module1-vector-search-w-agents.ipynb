      "- Both are AI-focused engineers with 4 years of experience and an M.S. in a closely related field.\n",
      "- Kenji specializes in building AI systems using Python (and related ML frameworks like PyTorch), has experience taking AI from research to production (similar to Lucas’s end-to-end AI applications), and works on natural language processing—an area Lucas has also tackled.\n",
      "- Both have built web-facing AI applications leveraging Python and machine learning, and have a strong mix of research and production engineering, with a clear focus on integrating ML into user-facing solutions.\n",

      "text/markdown": "To answer your question, I searched the resumes of Skynet employees for direct evidence of AI and ML-focused project collaboration. My relevance inference is based on:\n\n- Direct project descriptions: Looking for references to AI/ML product development delivered as collaborative efforts.\n- Overlaps in roles/timelines: Identifying whether two or more individuals worked in the same organizations, teams, or projects on AI/ML.\n- Explicit mention of cross-functional or team leadership in AI/ML initiatives.\n\nAnalysis from Retrieved Employee Summaries:\n- Omar Ibrahim led cross-functional AI product development and managed teams building AI-driven fintech products (credit scoring, ML platforms). He is experienced as a product manager for AI/ML platforms.\n- Emily Chen managed a data science team delivering AI-powered financial products, including a fraud detection system and recommendation engine.\n- Both Omar Ibrahim (Technical Product Manager) and Emily Chen (Data Science Manager) held leadership roles in AI/ML product development at fintech companies, with clear emphasis on cross-functional teams.\n- The resumes of James Mitchell and Miguel Santos point to experience in backend, infrastructure, and engineering leadership, but do not explicitly mention leadership or delivery of AI/ML projects.\n- Lisa Wang’s experience is in data analysis and analytics—she has built dashboards and A/B testing frameworks but does not list AI/ML product delivery as a focus.\n\nMost Notable AI/ML Collaboration:\nOmar Ibrahim and Emily Chen are the individuals most likely to have collaborated on delivering AI/ML products, particularly in the fintech context. Their simultaneous involvement in cross-functional AI/ML project leadership and management, with emphasis on product and model delivery (credit scoring, fraud detection, recommendations), strongly suggests joint contribution to these initiatives. This was proven relevant by similar fintech, AI/ML product context, and overlapping leadership experiences with references to cross-team collaboration.\n\nSummary:\n- Omar Ibrahim and Emily Chen have most likely collaborated together in delivering multiple AI and ML-driven solutions at Skynet, especially in cross-functional project team settings.\n- This finding is based on project history, leadership roles, collaborative terms (\"cross-functional teams\"), and context overlap extracted from their resumes during document search. No other individuals have as much combined and collaborative documentation of AI/ML delivery."
